# Theme 1.0: 	Development
"As a user, I want to easily find this site and what I am looking for on the webpage so that I can efficiently navigate the website and find the information I need. By conducting a card sorting exercise and implementing a new navigation structure with clear and concise labels, we can improve searchability and pass W3C validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner. This will enable us to provide a user-friendly experience and enhance website performance. By following Agile principles, we can quickly and effectively deliver a more usable webpage, setting us up for long-term success."

## Test plan
* Test the usability of the website by conducting user testing or surveys to gather feedback on the new navigation structure and searchability improvements.
* Use W3C's validation tool to ensure that the website conforms to web standards and accessibility guidelines.
* Use Google's Lighthouse tool to measure website performance and identify areas for improvement, such as page speed and load time.
