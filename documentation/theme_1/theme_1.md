# Theme 1.0: Project Setup

## Overview
As a student, I want to easily access educational resources and participate in online classes, so that I can learn from anywhere at any time. By developing a user-friendly interface and integrating web conferencing tools, we can create a dynamic online learning environment. This will enable us to expand our reach and provide more opportunities for education to people who may not have access otherwise. By following the Agile methodology and user-centered design principles, we can quickly and effectively develop a website that meets the needs of our users, setting us up for long-term success.
